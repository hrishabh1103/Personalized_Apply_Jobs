# Career-Ops

[English](README.md) 
## What Is This

Career-Ops turns any AI coding CLI into a full job search command center. Instead of manually tracking applications in a spreadsheet, you get an AI-powered pipeline that:

- **Evaluates offers** with a structured A-F scoring system (10 weighted dimensions)
- **Generates tailored PDFs** -- ATS-optimized CVs customized per job description
- **Scans portals** automatically (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, company pages)
- **Processes in batch** -- evaluate 10+ offers in parallel with sub-agents
- **Tracks everything** in a single source of truth with integrity checks

> **Important: This is NOT a spray-and-pray tool.** Career-ops is a filter -- it helps you find the few offers worth your time out of hundreds. The system strongly recommends against applying to anything scoring below 4.0/5. Your time is valuable, and so is the recruiter's. Always review before submitting.

Career-ops is agentic: Claude Code navigates career pages with Playwright, evaluates fit by reasoning about your CV vs the job description (not keyword matching), and adapts your resume per listing.

> **Heads up: the first evaluations won't be great.** The system doesn't know you yet. Feed it context -- your CV, your career story, your proof points, your preferences, what you're good at, what you want to avoid. The more you nurture it, the better it gets. Think of it as onboarding a new recruiter: the first week they need to learn about you, then they become invaluable.

Built by someone who used it to evaluate 740+ job offers, generate 100+ tailored CVs, and land a Head of Applied AI role. [Read the full case study](https://santifer.io/career-ops-system).

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/hrishabh1103/Personalized_Apply_Jobs.git
cd Personalized_Apply_Jobs && npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # Required for PDF generation

# 2. Check setup
npm run doctor                     # Validates all prerequisites

# 3. Configure
cp config/profile.example.yml config/profile.yml  # Edit with your details
cp templates/portals.example.yml portals.yml       # Customize companies

# 4. Add your CV
# Create cv.md in the project root with your CV in markdown

# 5. Personalize with Claude
claude   # Open Claude Code in this directory

# Then ask Claude to adapt the system to you:
# "Change the archetypes to backend engineering roles"
# "Translate the modes to English"
# "Add these 5 companies to portals.yml"
# "Update my profile with this CV I'm pasting"

# 6. Start using
# Paste a job URL or run /career-ops
```

> **The system is designed to be customized by Claude itself.** Modes, archetypes, scoring weights, negotiation scripts -- just ask Claude to change them. It reads the same files it uses, so it knows exactly what to edit.

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for the full setup guide.

## Gemini CLI Integration

Career-ops supports [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) natively — the same way it supports Claude Code and OpenCode. All 15 slash commands are available, using the same `modes/*.md` evaluation logic.

### Option A — Native Gemini CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install Gemini CLI
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
# or: npx @google/gemini-cli --version

# 2. Authenticate (free — uses your Google account)
gemini auth

# 3. Run in the career-ops directory
cd career-ops
gemini

# 4. Use slash commands just like Claude Code
/career-ops "Senior AI Engineer at Anthropic..."
/career-ops-evaluate --file ./jds/openai.txt
/career-ops-scan
/career-ops-pdf
/career-ops-tracker
```

The `GEMINI.md` file is auto-loaded as context. All 15 commands are defined in `.gemini/commands/*.toml`.

### Option B — Standalone API Script (No CLI install needed)

```bash
# 1. Get a free API key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env → set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Evaluate a job description
node gemini-eval.mjs "We are looking for a Senior AI Engineer..."
node gemini-eval.mjs --file ./jds/my-job.txt
npm run gemini:eval -- "JD text here"
```

> **Free tier:** Both options work without billing. Native CLI uses Google OAuth; the API script uses `gemini-2.0-flash` (15 RPM, 1M tokens/day free).

## Usage

Career-ops is a single slash command with multiple modes:

```
/career-ops                → Show all available commands
/career-ops {paste a JD}   → Full auto-pipeline (evaluate + PDF + tracker)
/career-ops scan           → Scan portals for new offers
/career-ops pdf            → Generate ATS-optimized CV
/career-ops batch          → Batch evaluate multiple offers
/career-ops tracker        → View application status
/career-ops apply          → Fill application forms with AI
/career-ops pipeline       → Process pending URLs
/career-ops contacto       → LinkedIn outreach message
/career-ops deep           → Deep company research
/career-ops training       → Evaluate a course/cert
/career-ops project        → Evaluate a portfolio project
```

Or just paste a job URL or description directly -- career-ops auto-detects it and runs the full pipeline.

## How It Works

```
You paste a job URL or description
